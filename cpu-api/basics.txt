fork() basics

Negative Value: The creation of a child process was unsuccessful.
Zero: Returned to the newly created child process.
Positive value: Returned to parent or caller. The value contains the
process ID of the newly created child process.

In the original process, you get the PID of the child process. 
In the child process, you get 0.

total processes = 2^no. of forks



wait() basics

If any process has more than one child processes, then after calling
wait(), parent process has to be in wait state if no child terminates. 
If only one child process is terminated, then return.
a wait() returns process ID of the terminated child process. 



strdup() basics

char *strdup(const char *s); 
This function returns a pointer to a null-terminated byte string, 
which is a duplicate of the string pointed to by s. The memory obtained
is done dynamically using malloc and hence it can be freed using free(). 
It returns a pointer to the duplicated string s.
